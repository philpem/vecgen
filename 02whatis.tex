\section{So what is the DVG?}
The Digital Vector Generator --- or DVG --- is a custom-designed CPU, built
entirely from small-scale TTL ICs. It has an architecture totally unlike that
of any CPU that existed at the time, and was designed specifically to drive
vector-beam monitors. This was done because no CPU available at the time
Asteroids was designed had enough power to manage game logic and draw vectors
at the same time. Offloading the task of drawing the display on to the DVG
allows the CPU to be dedicated to the task of running the game logic.

The DVG features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{12-bit program counter, with 13-bit address space}
	\item{Four-level stack}
	\item{State machine microsequencer with eight micro-instructions}
	\item{Vector timer}
	\item{Two 12-bit binary rate multipliers to vary the timing relationship between the X and Y vectors}
	\item{16-level brightness control}
	\item{1024x1024 display resolution}
\end{itemize}
